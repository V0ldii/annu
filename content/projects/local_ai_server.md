title: "Local AI Server"
---


In this project, I set up a local AI server environment to support efficient AI model deployment and management on a personal machine. Leveraging **Ollama** for seamless model downloading and **OpenUI** for intuitive interaction, I created a streamlined platform for working with large language models, like Llama 3, directly on my device. This setup combines the flexibility of Docker for containerized management and Python version control with **pyenv**, ensuring compatibility across various dependencies.

Throughout the project, I encountered and resolved key challenges, including environment configuration and permission management, optimizing the workflow for smooth AI model handling without needing external cloud resources. This guide details each step, from setup to model interaction, providing a comprehensive roadmap for anyone aiming to deploy and experiment with AI models locally.
