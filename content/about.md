Hi thereðŸ‘‹

I am Annu Jangra, but you can just call me Annu (cute name, right? hehe). Anyway, I am currently busy completing my bachelor's in computer science.

The best way to describe myself? Maybe an all-rounder (just kidding)! But seriously, Iâ€™m someone you could call a "jack of all trades, master of none." That probably tells you I have tons of interests, right? If not, now you know. Iâ€™d say I can do a bit of everythingâ€”well, except singing. 

But hey, I can still jam along! Not so bad, right? Do I sound fun? I hope I do.

Iâ€™m particularly interested in exploring technology, programming, and cybersecurity, and Iâ€™m always excited to learn new things in these fields. 

Feel free to connect with me on any of these platforms:
