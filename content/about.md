Hi thereðŸ‘‹

I am Annu Jangra, but you can just call me Annu (cute name, right? hehe). Anyway, I am currently busy completing my bachelor's in computer science.

The best way to describe myself would be an all-rounder (haha, joking), but seriously, I am someone you could refer to as a "jack of all trades, master of none."

That might give you an idea that I have lots and lots of interests, right? If not, well, now you know that I could do everything â€” the only exception being singing. Hey, wait, I could still jam with it.

Not so bad, right? Do I sound fun? I hope I do.

Anyway, if you want to connect, just find me here:
